```tsx
hook.js:608 A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used: - A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`. - Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called. - Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server. - External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML. - Invalid HTML tag nesting. It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
